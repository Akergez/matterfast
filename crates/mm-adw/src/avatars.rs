//! Profile picture cache.
//!
//! `gdk::Texture` is not `Send` and the download must not block the UI, so the
//! split is: fetch bytes on Tokio, decode into a texture on the GTK thread,
//! keep it in a plain `RefCell` map. Everything here therefore runs on the main
//! thread and needs no locking beyond that.
//!
//! The server always returns *an* image — it renders default initials for users
//! who never uploaded one — so there is no "user has no avatar" case to handle.
//! There is only "not fetched yet", which shows libadwaita's own initials until
//! the picture lands.
