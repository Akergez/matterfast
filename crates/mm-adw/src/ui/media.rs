//! Playing an attached video or audio file where it was posted.
//!
//! A [`Player`] starts as a poster — a still, or failing that just the name,
//! the size and a play button — and only downloads the *whole* file when
//! someone presses play, because a channel scrolled past ten videos would
//! otherwise fetch ten videos. The still itself costs far less: the server
//! makes no thumbnail for video (it 400s `no_thumbnail`, confirmed against a
//! live server), so [`video_still`] builds one from just the head of the file
//! — see there for how much that is and which containers it works for.
//!
//! The file itself is behind the session token, so a URL handed to GStreamer
//! would come back 401; the bytes arrive the same way `open_image` gets an
//! image, through the client, and are handed back with [`Player::set_data`].
