//! Joining and running a call.

//! # Join sequence
//!
//! ```text
//!  A. REST      GET /plugins/com.mattermost.calls/version   → dc locking?
//!               GET /plugins/com.mattermost.calls/config    → ICE, feature flags
//!               GET .../turn-credentials                    → only if NeedsTURNCredentials
//!  B. WS        `hello` → connection_id  ⇒ THIS IS OUR SESSION ID
//!               send  calls_join {channelID, jobID:"", av1Support, dcSignaling}
//!               await calls_join ack (data.connID == our session id)
//!  C. RTC       build PeerConnection, create the `calls-dc` data channel
//!               (creating it is what makes negotiation "needed")
//!               create offer → send `sdp` as a BINARY msgpack frame
//!               trickle ICE via `ice` text frames
//!               await `signal` answer → set remote description
//!               ICE → DTLS → SCTP → the data channel opens
//!               the SFU then offers one renegotiation per existing remote track
//!  D. Audio     add the Opus track (taking the signalling lock first),
//!               renegotiate, then send `unmute`
//! ```
//!
//! # Failures that are silent if you get them wrong
//!
//! * **SDP as anything but a binary msgpack frame** — the plugin's `[]byte`
//!   assertion fails and the offer vanishes.
//! * **Renegotiating without the signalling lock** — the SFU is the impolite
//!   peer and drops the offer, leaving us stuck in `have-local-offer`. The lock
//!   is gated on the *server version*, not on whether data-channel signalling
//!   is enabled: the SFU takes it for its own offers either way.
//! * **Not buffering ICE candidates that arrive before the answer** — the SFU
//!   starts gathering inside `SetLocalDescription`, so candidates routinely
//!   arrive first, and `add_ice_candidate` rejects them outright until a remote
//!   description exists.
//! * **Not sending `reconnect` every time the websocket reopens** — the plugin
//!   does not know or care whether the transport resumed; any socket teardown
//!   starts a ten-second timer that ends the call, and until `reconnect`
//!   arrives everything we send is dropped.
//! * **Not attaching the audio-level RTP extension** — voice activity is
//!   computed server-side, so you are audible but never shown as speaking.
