# Matras

A native Mattermost client for GNOME — GTK4 + libadwaita, in Rust.

<img src="/docs/screenshots/main.png" />

Four crates:

| Crate | What it is |
|---|---|
| `mattermost-api` | Async Mattermost client: REST v4, models, and a reliable WebSocket with replay-aware reconnect. No GTK dependency. |
| `mattermost-calls` | The Mattermost Calls wire protocol and a WebRTC peer (webrtc-rs). No GTK dependency. |
| `matras` | The application: an adaptive libadwaita window. |
| `matras-testserver` | A fake Mattermost, real enough to exercise the client end to end. Dev-only. |

The two library crates are deliberately independent of the UI — they are usable
for a bot, a CLI, or a different front end.

## Status

**Working**

- Sign in (password + MFA), session token handling, `X-Requested-With`, no cookie jar
- **Single sign-on** through the browser, using Mattermost's desktop-token
  flow — see below
- The session token lives in the **Secret Service**, not a file, because it
  grants the whole account until somebody revokes it. Several servers can be
  stored side by side; a launch with more than one asks which
- Startup sequence in the order the official clients use it (config → teams → channels → categories)
- Adaptive layout: channel sidebar, conversation, and a right-hand panel that
  holds either a thread or the inbox; teams and the signed-in account live in a
  switcher popover in the sidebar header
- A thread earns a static third column when there is room; the inbox always
  overlays, because a stack you glance at should not shove the conversation
  aside
- **Call dock** pinned under the channel list: who is talking, how many are in
  it, the way back to its channel, and every in-call control. A call outlives
  the channel it started in, so its controls cannot live in that channel's
  header. On a phone-sized window the dock moves under the conversation
- Sidebar rows carry the faces of whoever is in a channel's call
- Sidebar categories with the real ordering rules, unread/mention/muted
  styling, and a row menu to mute a channel or move it to another category
- Virtualized message list: only the visible screenful has GTK widgets, while
  author grouping, day separators, edits, attachments, message priority,
  system messages and webhook name overrides remain intact
- **Profile pictures and media**, shared in memory and persisted in an
  expiring disk cache. Storage has a 5 GiB default global limit, LRU eviction,
  and a Storage panel where the limit can be changed or the cache cleared
- **Reactions as emoji**, not `:shortcodes:` — click a chip to toggle your own,
  pick one from the hover menu, or search the whole Unicode set. A server's own
  uploads are drawn as pictures, through the same image cache as avatars
- **Threads**: the reply count opens the thread in the right panel, replies go
  to the root's channel, and collapsed reply threads (CRT) are respected — a
  reply never leaks into the channel feed. The thread's reply box keeps its own
  synced draft, the way the server stores them
- **Profile card** on any avatar or name: picture, presence, position, custom
  status, the person's local time, and a button that opens the DM
- **Inbox**: recent mentions, followed threads and saved posts, with a count on
  the header button
- Sending messages, optimistically, with the server echo retiring the local copy
- **Editing, deleting, pinning, saving and marking unread**, from each
  message's own menu — plus edit history, reminders, and moving a whole thread
  to another channel
- **Message priority** set from the composer, and a button to acknowledge a
  post that asked for one
- **Scheduled messages**, with a list to change your mind before they go
- **Autocomplete** for `@names` and `:emoji`, answering from what is already
  loaded first so a keystroke never waits on a request
- **Markdown**: bold, italic, strikethrough, links, headings, nested lists,
  quotes, inline code, and fenced code blocks on their own panel
- **Permalinks** render as the message they point at, since the server has
  already resolved it and fetching it again would be work for nothing
- **Attachments**: pick, drag in, or paste an image. Anything large goes
  through a resumable upload session, so a stalled upload continues from where
  the server got to instead of starting over. Images draw themselves and open
  full size
- **Drafts**, synced through the server so the same unfinished message is
  waiting on every device
- **Channels**: create, browse, join, leave, rename, edit the header, archive;
  a member list you can add to and remove from; per-channel notification
  settings; bookmarks. Teams can be browsed and joined
- **Your account**: edit the profile and the avatar, set a status and a custom
  status, and edit the notification settings that decide every toast
- **Search** across a team, with results in the right panel — `file:` in front
  of the terms searches attachments instead, rather than adding a second box to
  find
- **Ctrl+K** jumps to a channel or a person, opening the DM if there is not one
  yet
- **Desktop notifications** following the server's own rules, and a snapshot
  cache so launching draws last session's channels immediately. Closing the
  window keeps the process, the socket and the notifications alive — a chat
  client you have to keep a window open for is not one
- **Calls**: join, mute, share a screen or camera, raise a hand, see who is in
  the call, and a dock that stays put when you read somewhere else. A call in a
  DM or a group rings, with Join and Dismiss on the notification; a host can
  mute or remove someone
- **Plugins**: the Agents LLM module (streamed answers, thread summaries,
  "catch me up") and reaction notifications
- Live updates over the websocket, including a correct reliable-reconnect resync

**Not done yet**

The honest list lives in [docs/PARITY.md](docs/PARITY.md) — what is missing,
ordered by how often it bites, with the routes that would close each gap. The
short version: no scrollback past the newest sixty messages in a channel, no
link previews, no slash commands, non-image attachments cannot be saved,
`:shortcodes:` typed into a message stay as text, and there is a snapshot cache
rather than a real local store.

## Single sign-on

The GitLab button sends the browser to `/oauth/gitlab/login?desktop_token=…`.
The server cannot redirect an OAuth callback to a loopback port — it insists the
redirect matches the site's own scheme and host — so the answer comes back
through a URL scheme instead: Mattermost bounces the browser to a page that
deep-links to `mattermost-dev://…`, which launches this app, and the token in
that URI is traded for a session.

That only works once the desktop file is installed, so the browser knows what
handles the scheme. A packaged build gets this for free. From a source tree:

```sh
cargo build
sed "s|^Exec=matras|Exec=$PWD/target/debug/matras|" \
  data/ru.toxblh.Matras.desktop \
  > ~/.local/share/applications/ru.toxblh.Matras.desktop
update-desktop-database ~/.local/share/applications
xdg-mime default ru.toxblh.Matras.desktop x-scheme-handler/mattermost-dev
```

The scheme is `mattermost-dev`, not `mattermost`, so nothing collides with the
official desktop app; the server picks it because the token starts with `dev-`.
The app must already be running when the callback arrives — the browser hands
the URI to the live instance over D-Bus.

## Install

A signed flatpak repository is published from this project's own CI. One click
on the ref file adds the remote and installs the app; everything after that is
an ordinary `flatpak update`:

```sh
flatpak install https://altlinux.space/toxblh/flatpak/raw/branch/master/ru.toxblh.Matras.flatpakref
```

The runtime comes from Flathub, so that remote has to exist — the ref file
points at it and flatpak will offer to add it.

## Building


Needs Rust 1.85+, GTK 4.12+ and libadwaita 1.5+.

```sh
# Debian/Ubuntu
sudo apt install libgtk-4-dev libadwaita-1-dev libssl-dev pkg-config build-essential

cargo build --release
cargo test --workspace
```

Run it:

```sh
./target/release/matras
```

To look at the layout without a server:

```sh
MATRAS_DEMO=1 ./target/release/matras
```

## Testing against a server

`matras-testserver` is a fake Mattermost with real state: it hands out real ids,
serves avatars, keeps threads and reactions, and pushes the same websocket
events the real server does — including the double-encoded payloads and the
inconsistent key casing, because reproducing those is the point.

```sh
cargo run -p matras-testserver          # 127.0.0.1:8065, logs every request

MATRAS_SERVER=http://127.0.0.1:8065 \
MATRAS_USER=anton MATRAS_PASSWORD=test \
  cargo run -p matras               # skips the sign-in form
```

A background "colleague" posts every 12 seconds (`MM_BOT_SECONDS` to change it)
so live updates are visible with one client open. The same three environment
variables work against a real server.

> On a minimal system, install `librsvg2-common` too — without the SVG pixbuf
> loader every symbolic icon renders as a broken-image box, which looks like an
> application bug and is not one.

## Using the libraries

```rust
use mattermost_api::{Client, WebSocket, ws::{WsUpdate, Event}};

let client = Client::new("https://mm.example.com")?;
client.login("alice", "hunter2", None).await?;

let ws = WebSocket::connect(client.websocket_url(), client.token().unwrap());
let mut rx = ws.subscribe();

while let Ok(update) = rx.recv().await {
    match update {
        WsUpdate::Event(Event::Posted(p)) => println!("{}: {}", p.sender_name, p.post.message),
        // The server could not replay its buffer — refetch.
        WsUpdate::MissedMessages => { /* full resync */ }
        _ => {}
    }
}
```

Joining a call:

```rust
use mattermost_calls::{config, CallSession, JoinOptions};

let discovery = config::discover(&client).await?;
let call = CallSession::join(
    &client,
    ws,
    JoinOptions { channel_id: channel_id.into(), ..Default::default() },
    &discovery,
).await?;

let track = call.unmute().await?;   // then write Opus samples into `track`
```

## Notes on the protocol

Mattermost's REST API is documented; its WebSocket payloads and the Calls
protocol largely are not. `docs/PROTOCOL.md` records what was found by reading
`mattermost/mattermost`, `mattermost-plugin-calls`, `rtcd` and `calls-common`,
including several behaviours that fail *silently* if you get them wrong.

## Publishing the flatpak

`.forgejo/workflows/flatpak.yml` builds the manifest in `build-aux/` on every
push to `master` and force-pushes the resulting ostree repository to
`toxblh/flatpak` on ALS, where Forgejo's `raw/branch/master` endpoint serves it
as an ordinary HTTP flatpak remote. There is no static host to keep alive.

The repository it pushes to is `toxblh/flatpak`, public, so that Forgejo will
serve it to anonymous clients. CI authenticates with a write **deploy key** on
that one repository rather than an account token, and pins the host key.

Five Actions secrets on this repository drive it:

| Secret | Value |
|---|---|
| `FLATPAK_GPG_ID` | fingerprint of the signing key |
| `FLATPAK_GPG_KEY_B64` | `gpg2 --export-secret-keys <fpr> \| base64 -w0` |
| `FLATPAK_GPG_PASSPHRASE` | that key's passphrase |
| `FLATPAK_REPO_SSH_KEY_B64` | the deploy key's private half, base64 |
| `FLATPAK_REPO_KNOWN_HOSTS` | `ssh-keyscan altlinux.space`, fingerprint-verified |

The signing key never enters a personal keyring: it lives as an exported
blob beside its passphrase, and every publish — local or CI — imports it into
a throwaway `GNUPGHOME` the same way.

```sh
~/.config/als-forgejo/matras-flatpak-key.b64   # FLATPAK_GPG_KEY_B64
~/.config/als-forgejo/matras-flatpak-pass      # FLATPAK_GPG_PASSPHRASE
```

That homedir also gets a stub pinentry, because ostree signs through gpgme,
which cannot hand a passphrase to gpg-agent itself, and the build image has
no pinentry to prompt with.

The workflow writes `ru.toxblh.Matras.flatpakref` into the published repository
itself, with the public key embedded, so the install link above always carries
the key that signed what it points at.

The same script builds locally, into `.flatpak-repo`:

```sh
build-aux/publish-flatpak.sh
flatpak install --user .flatpak-repo ru.toxblh.Matras
```
